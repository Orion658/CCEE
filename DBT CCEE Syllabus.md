### Introduction to DBMS:

**Database Management System (DBMS)**:

-   A DBMS is software that facilitates the creation, organization, retrieval, and manipulation of data in a database.
-   It serves as an interface between the database and end-users or applications, ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient access.

**Basic Database Terminology**:

1.  **Data**:
    1.  Raw facts, figures, or symbols that represent information.
    2.  Example: In a university database, student names, course codes, and grades are all considered data.
2.  **Database**:
    1.  An organized collection of related data stored electronically.
    2.  Example: A university database may contain tables for students, courses, professors, and grades, each storing relevant information.
3.  **Table**:
    1.  A fundamental component of a relational database, consisting of rows and columns.
    2.  Example: A "Students" table may have columns like "StudentID," "Name," "Age," and "Major," with each row representing a unique student.
4.  **Row (Tuple)**:
    1.  A horizontal collection of data in a table representing a single record.
    2.  Example: In the "Students" table, each row contains information about one student, such as their name, age, and major.
5.  **Column (Attribute)**:
    1.  A vertical collection of data in a table representing a specific characteristic.
    2.  Example: The "Name" column in the "Students" table stores the names of all students enrolled in the university.
6.  **Primary Key**:
    1.  A unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval.
    2.  Example: In the "Students" table, the "StudentID" column may serve as the primary key, ensuring each student has a unique identifier.

### Types of DBMS:

1.  **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**:
    1.  Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, establishing relationships between them.
    2.  Uses structured query language (SQL) for data manipulation and retrieval.
    3.  Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.
2.  **Object-Relational DBMS**:
    1.  Extends relational database capabilities to include object-oriented features like inheritance and encapsulation.
    2.  Allows for complex data types and relationships beyond traditional RDBMS.
    3.  Example: PostgreSQL with object-relational features enabled.
3.  **NoSQL Databases**:
    1.  Non-relational databases designed for scalability, flexibility, and handling diverse data types.
    2.  Suitable for applications with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
    3.  Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Cassandra (wide-column), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).

### Introduction to MySQL:

**MySQL**:

-   MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation.
-   It is one of the most popular database systems used for web applications, particularly in conjunction with the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack.
-   MySQL is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use, making it a preferred choice for various applications ranging from small-scale websites to large-scale enterprises.

**Key Features of MySQL**:

1.  **Relational Database**: MySQL organizes data into tables with rows and columns, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of structured data.
2.  **SQL Support**: It supports standard SQL (Structured Query Language), enabling users to perform a wide range of database operations such as querying, updating, and managing data.
3.  **Scalability**: MySQL is scalable and can handle large datasets and high traffic loads, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.
4.  **Security**: It offers robust security features including access control, encryption, and authentication mechanisms to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.
5.  **Community Support**: With a large and active community of developers and users, MySQL benefits from continuous improvement, updates, and support resources.

### MySQL Clients:

**1. MySQL Monitor**:

-   **Description**: MySQL Monitor, also known as the MySQL Command-Line Client, is a command-line interface for interacting with MySQL databases.
-   **Functionality**: It allows users to execute SQL queries, view database information, and perform administrative tasks directly from the command line.
-   **Usage Example**: `$ mysql -u username -p` initiates a MySQL session, prompting for the user's password. Once authenticated, users can execute SQL queries like `SELECT * FROM table_name;` to retrieve data.

**2. MySQL Shell**:

-   **Description**: MySQL Shell is an advanced command-line client and scripting interface for MySQL databases.
-   **Functionality**: It supports SQL, JavaScript, and Python languages for querying, administration, and automation tasks.
-   **Usage Example**: `mysqlsh --sql` starts the MySQL Shell in SQL mode, allowing users to execute SQL statements. Alternatively, users can switch to JavaScript or Python mode for scripting tasks.

**3. MySQL Workbench**:

-   **Description**: MySQL Workbench is a visual database design and administration tool provided by MySQL.
-   **Functionality**: It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for designing database schemas, writing SQL queries, managing users, and monitoring database performance.
-   **Usage Example**: Users can use MySQL Workbench to visually create database entities such as tables, relationships, and indexes, and then execute SQL queries through the built-in query editor.

By leveraging these MySQL clients, users can interact with MySQL databases effectively, whether through command-line interfaces for quick tasks or graphical tools for visual database design and administration.

### Data Models:

**1. Conceptual Data Model**:

-   **Description**: A high-level, abstract representation of the relationships between different entities in a system, independent of any specific database management system (DBMS) or technical implementation.
-   **Purpose**: It focuses on the entities, attributes, and relationships between them, providing a foundation for understanding the business requirements and data semantics.
-   **Example**: In a conceptual data model for a university system, entities like "Student," "Course," and "Professor" are identified, along with their attributes and relationships, without specifying how they are stored in a database.

**2. Logical Data Model**:

-   **Description**: A detailed representation of the data structures, relationships, and constraints in a database, often expressed using a data modeling language like Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or Unified Modeling Language (UML).
-   **Purpose**: It translates the conceptual data model into a format that can be implemented in a specific DBMS, defining tables, columns, keys, and relationships.
-   **Example**: In a logical data model, entities from the conceptual model are mapped to tables, attributes become columns, and relationships are represented through foreign keys, providing a blueprint for database implementation.

**3. Physical Data Model**:

-   **Description**: A technical representation of how data is stored and accessed in a specific DBMS, including details such as data types, indexes, partitioning, and storage optimization.
-   **Purpose**: It defines the physical implementation of the database, optimizing performance, storage, and scalability based on the requirements of the application and the capabilities of the underlying hardware and software.
-   **Example**: In a physical data model, the logical entities and relationships are translated into database objects like tables, indexes, and partitions, with considerations for storage engines, file structures, and access methods.

### Database Design and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

**Database Design**:

-   **Description**: The process of creating a database schema based on the requirements identified in the conceptual and logical data models.
-   **Steps**: It involves entity identification, attribute definition, normalization, relationship establishment, and schema refinement to ensure data integrity, efficiency, and usability.
-   **Example**: Designing a database for a library management system would entail defining entities like "Book," "Author," and "Borrower," determining their attributes and relationships, and organizing them into normalized tables.

**Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:

-   **Description**: A visual representation of the entities, attributes, and relationships in a database, using symbols like rectangles (entities), diamonds (relationships), and ovals (attributes).
-   **Purpose**: It provides a clear and concise overview of the database structure, facilitating communication between stakeholders and guiding the database design process.
-   **Example**: An ERD for a social media platform would show entities like "User," "Post," and "Comment," their attributes (e.g., user ID, post content), and relationships (e.g., user-posts, post-comments).

In an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), various symbols are used to represent different components and relationships within a database model. Here's a list of the most common symbols used in ERDs:

1.  **Entity**:
    1.  Represents a real-world object or concept, typically shown as a rectangle.
    2.  Example: "Customer," "Product," "Employee."
2.  **Attribute**:
    1.  Describes a characteristic or property of an entity, usually shown within the entity rectangle.
    2.  Example: "CustomerID," "ProductName," "EmployeeName."
3.  **Primary Key**:
    1.  Identifies a unique attribute or combination of attributes within an entity.
    2.  Typically indicated with an underline or a key symbol.
    3.  Example: Underlining "CustomerID" to denote it as the primary key of the "Customer" entity.
4.  **Relationship**:
    1.  Describes the association between two or more entities.
    2.  Represented by a line connecting the related entities, often labeled with the type of relationship.
    3.  Example: "Customer" has a "Purchases" relationship with "Product."
5.  **Cardinality**:
    1.  Indicates the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with another entity.
    2.  Represented near the endpoints of the relationship line using symbols such as "1," "M," or "0..1," "0..\*".
    3.  Example: "One-to-One," "One-to-Many," "Many-to-Many."
6.  **Weak Entity**:
    1.  An entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone and depends on a related entity.
    2.  Represented with double rectangles.
    3.  Example: A "Room" entity in a "Hotel" database, which depends on the "Hotel" entity for identification.
7.  **Composite Attribute**:
    1.  An attribute that can be further subdivided into smaller parts.
    2.  Shown as an attribute inside another attribute with a dotted underline.
    3.  Example: "Address" attribute may include "Street," "City," and "Zip Code" sub-attributes.
8.  **Derived Attribute**:
    1.  An attribute whose value is derived from other attributes.
    2.  Represented with a dashed underline.
    3.  Example: "Age" attribute derived from "Date of Birth."
9.  **Multivalued Attribute**:
    1.  An attribute that can hold multiple values for a single entity instance.
    2.  Represented with double ovals.
    3.  Example: "Phone Numbers" attribute for a "Customer" entity.
10. **Relationship Strength**:
    1.  Describes the degree of association between a weak entity and its identifying entity.
    2.  Indicated with a double diamond or a thick relationship line.
    3.  Example: Strong relationship indicated by a regular line, weak relationship indicated by a thicker line or a double diamond symbol.

These symbols help in visualizing the structure of a database and the relationships between different entities and attributes within the database model.

### Codd’s 12 rules for RDBMS

Codd's 12 rules, formulated by Dr. Edgar F. Codd, outline the criteria that a database management system must meet to be considered a true relational database management system (RDBMS). Here are Codd's 12 rules for RDBMS:

**Rule 0: The Foundation Rule**:

States that for a system to qualify as a relational database management system, it must be able to manage databases entirely through its relational capabilities.

**Rule 1: The Information Rule**:

All information in the database must be logically represented in tables.

**Rule 2: Guaranteed Access Rule**:

Every single data item (atomic value) must be accessible by its table name, primary key, and column name.

**Rule 3: Systematic Treatment of NULL Values**:

NULL values must be supported and treated consistently, meaning they are distinct from empty strings, zeros, or any other value.

**Rule 4: Dynamic Online Catalog Based on the Relational Model**:

The database schema (catalog) must be represented relationally, accessible online, and modifiable using the same query language used to access the data.

**Rule 5: Comprehensive Data Sublanguage Rule**:

The system must support a comprehensive data sublanguage (like SQL) that is both relational and supports data definition, manipulation, and constraint specification.

**Rule 6: View Updating Rule**:

All views that are theoretically updatable must also be updatable by the system.

**Rule 7: High-Level Insert, Update, and Delete**:

The system must support high-level insertion, updating, and deleting of data, allowing users to work with data at a conceptual level rather than at the physical level.

**Rule 8: Physical Data Independence**:

Changes to the physical storage structures or access methods should not require changes to the application programs or queries.

**Rule 9: Logical Data Independence**:

Changes to the logical schema (table structures, views) should not require changes to the application programs or queries.

**Rule 10: Integrity Independence**:

Integrity constraints must be stored in the catalog and not within application programs.

**Rule 11: Distribution Independence**:

The distribution of portions of the database to various locations should not affect the conceptual or external level schemas.

**Rule 12: Nonsubversion Rule**:

If the system provides low-level access to the data, it must also provide high-level access to the same data to prevent bypassing security and integrity constraints.

These rules serve as a benchmark for evaluating the degree of adherence to relational principles by a database management system claiming to be relational. Meeting all 12 rules ensures that the system is a genuine relational database management system.

### Introduction to SQL:

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**:

-   SQL is a standard language used for managing relational databases.
-   It provides a set of commands for defining, manipulating, and querying data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
-   SQL is widely used across various industries and applications for tasks such as data retrieval, data manipulation, and database administration.

### Categories of SQL Commands:

SQL commands are broadly categorized into four main types:

1.  **DDL (Data Definition Language)**:
    1.  DDL commands are used to define the structure of a database, including creating, altering, and dropping database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.
2.  **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**:
    1.  DML commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database, including inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from tables.
3.  **DCL (Data Control Language)**:
    1.  DCL commands are used to control access to data in the database, including granting and revoking privileges and permissions to users and roles.
4.  **DTL/TCL (Data Transaction Language/Transaction Control Language)**:
    1.  DTL/TCL commands are used to manage transactions within the database, including committing, rolling back, and saving points within transactions.

### DDL Commands:

**1. CREATE**:

-   **Description**: Creates new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas.
-   **Syntax (for creating a table)**:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraints,
    column2 datatype constraints,
    ...
);
```

-   **Example**:

```
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

**2. ALTER**:

-   **Description**: Modifies the structure of existing database objects, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns in a table.
-   **Syntax (for adding a column to a table)**:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype constraints;
```

-   **Example**:

```
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
```

**3. DROP**:

-   **Description**: Deletes existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.
-   **Syntax (for dropping a table)**:

```
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

-   **Example**:

```
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

**4. TRUNCATE**:

-   **Description**: Removes all rows from a table, but keeps the table structure intact.
-   **Syntax**:

```
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

-   **Example**:

```
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
```

These DDL commands are fundamental for defining and managing the structure of a database, allowing users to create, modify, and delete database objects according to their requirements.

### 

### DML (Data Manipulation Language):

**Definition**:

-   DML commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database tables, including inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

**1. INSERT**:

-   **Description**: Adds new records (rows) into a table.
-   **Syntax**:

```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

-   **Example**:

```
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Department)
VALUES (101, 'John Doe', 'Finance');
```

**2. UPDATE**:

-   **Description**: Modifies existing records in a table.
-   **Syntax**:

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

-   **Example**:

```
UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'Human Resources'
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
```

**3. DELETE**:

-   **Description**: Removes records from a table.
-   **Syntax**:

```
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

-   **Example**:

```
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
```

**Notes**:

-   The WHERE clause in UPDATE and DELETE statements is optional but important to ensure that only specific records are affected.
-   When using the INSERT command, ensure that the values being inserted comply with any constraints defined on the table, such as NOT NULL or UNIQUE constraints.
-   It's essential to use DML commands with caution, especially DELETE, as they can permanently remove data from the database.

DML commands provide the means to manage the data within database tables, allowing users to add, modify, or delete records as needed to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the data.

### DCL (Data Control Language):

**1. GRANT**:

-   **Description**: Provides specific privileges to users or roles, allowing them to perform certain actions on database objects.
-   **Syntax**:

```
GRANT privileges ON object_name TO user_or_role;
```

-   **Example**:

```
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON Employees TO HR_Manager;
```

**2. REVOKE**:

-   **Description**: Revokes previously granted privileges from users or roles, restricting their access to database objects.
-   **Syntax**:

```
REVOKE privileges ON object_name FROM user_or_role;
```

-   **Example**:

```
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON Employees FROM HR_Manager;
```

### 

### DTL/TCL (Data Transaction Language/Transaction Control Language):

**1. COMMIT**:

-   **Description**: Saves all changes made during the current transaction to the database.
-   **Syntax**:

```
COMMIT;
```

-   **Example**:

```
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE Department = 'Finance';
COMMIT;
```

**2. ROLLBACK**:

-   **Description**: Rolls back all changes made during the current transaction to its initial state.
-   **Syntax**:

```
ROLLBACK;
```

-   **Example**:

```
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE Department = 'Finance';
ROLLBACK;
```

**3. SAVEPOINT**:

-   **Description**: Sets a named point within a transaction, allowing partial rollback to that point if needed.
-   **Syntax**:

```
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

-   **Example**:

```
SAVEPOINT before_update;
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE Department = 'Finance';
ROLLBACK TO before_update;
```

**4. SET TRANSACTION**:

-   **Description**: Specifies characteristics for the current transaction, such as isolation level and read/write behavior.
-   **Syntax**:

```
SET TRANSACTION [transaction_characteristics];
```

-   **Example**:

```
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

DCL commands control access to database objects by granting or revoking privileges, while DTL/TCL commands manage transactions by committing or rolling back changes and setting transaction characteristics. These commands play a vital role in maintaining data security, integrity, and consistency within the database system.

### Data Redundancy:

**Definition**:

-   Data redundancy refers to the unnecessary duplication of data within a database system.
-   It occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple locations or when related data is repeated across multiple records.

**Examples**:

1.  **Duplicate Information**: Storing the same customer address in multiple tables instead of referencing a single customer table.
2.  **Denormalized Data**: Replicating data across tables for performance reasons, leading to redundancy.

**Consequences**:

-   Increased storage space requirements.
-   Inconsistencies and discrepancies between duplicate data.
-   Update anomalies where changes to one instance of data are not reflected in all duplicates.

### Data Anomalies:

**Definition**:

-   Data anomalies are inconsistencies or irregularities in data that can occur due to poor database design or data manipulation operations.
-   They can manifest as insertion, update, or deletion anomalies.

**Types of Data Anomalies**:

1.  **Insertion Anomalies**: Difficulty inserting new data due to incomplete dependencies.
2.  **Update Anomalies**: Inconsistencies that arise when updating data in one place but not in all related places.
3.  **Deletion Anomalies**: Unintended loss of data when deleting records that contain necessary information for other records.

**Example**:

-   In a denormalized database, updating a customer's address requires updating multiple records, leading to update anomalies if not done consistently.

### Functional Dependency:

**Definition**:

-   Functional dependency is a relationship between attributes in a relation (table) where the value of one attribute uniquely determines the value of another attribute.
-   It is denoted as X -\> Y, where X determines Y, meaning for every value of X, there is only one corresponding value of Y.

**Example**:

-   In a "Employees" table, if "EmployeeID" uniquely determines "EmployeeName," then there is a functional dependency EmployeeID -\> EmployeeName.

**Types of Functional Dependencies**:

1.  **Full Functional Dependency**: Y is fully functionally dependent on X, meaning removing any attribute from X would result in breaking the dependency.
2.  **Partial Functional Dependency**: Y is partially dependent on X, meaning removing some attributes from X may still determine Y.

**Use in Database Design**:

-   Understanding functional dependencies is crucial for normalization, where the goal is to minimize data redundancy and avoid update anomalies by organizing data into well-structured relations.

### 

### Normalization:

**Definition**:

-   Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency by decomposing tables into smaller, well-structured relations.
-   It helps improve data integrity, reduce anomalies, and optimize database performance.

**Need for Normalization**:

1.  **Data Redundancy Reduction**: Eliminates duplicate data, saving storage space and ensuring consistency.
2.  **Data Anomaly Prevention**: Minimizes insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, maintaining data integrity.
3.  **Simplification of Data Structures**: Breaks down complex tables into smaller, manageable entities, facilitating easier maintenance and querying.

### Normal Forms:

1.  **First Normal Form (1NF)**:
    1.  Ensures that each table has a primary key and that all attributes contain atomic (indivisible) values.
    2.  Example: Splitting a "Student" table into "StudentID," "StudentName," and "Address" columns to ensure atomicity.
2.  **Second Normal Form (2NF)**:
    1.  Requires that each non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
    2.  Example: If a table has a composite primary key like {StudentID, CourseID}, attributes like "StudentName" should depend only on "StudentID," not on both "StudentID" and "CourseID."
3.  **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
    1.  Ensures that there are no transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.
    2.  Example: If an "Employee" table has attributes like "Department" and "Manager," where "Manager" depends on "Department," it should be moved to a separate "Department" table to eliminate transitive dependency.
4.  **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**:
    1.  A stricter form of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.
    2.  Example: If in a "Supplier" table, both {SupplierID} and {ProductID} determine "SupplierName," it's necessary to split the table into two: "Supplier" and "Supplier_Product."

### Introduction to 4th and 5th Normal Forms:

1.  **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**:
    1.  Focuses on multivalued dependencies and ensures that no non-trivial multivalued dependencies exist between attributes.
    2.  Example: If a table has attributes like "CustomerID," "PhoneNumber," and "EmailAddress," where each customer can have multiple phone numbers and email addresses, those should be moved to a separate table.
2.  **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**:
    1.  Addresses join dependencies, ensuring that no non-trivial join dependencies exist between attributes.
    2.  Example: If a table has attributes like "CourseID," "Professor," and "Textbook," where each course can have multiple textbooks, those should be moved to a separate table to eliminate join dependencies.

By progressively normalizing a database to higher normal forms, database designers can reduce redundancy, prevent anomalies, and ensure data integrity, leading to more efficient and maintainable database systems.

### MySQL Data Types:

MySQL supports various data types for storing different kinds of data:

1.  **Numeric Data Types**:
    1.  INT, TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT
    2.  DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT, DOUBLE
2.  **Date and Time Data Types**:
    1.  DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, YEAR
3.  **String Data Types**:
    1.  CHAR, VARCHAR, BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB
    2.  TEXT, ENUM, SET
4.  **Miscellaneous Data Types**:
    1.  BOOLEAN, JSON, GEOMETRY, UUID

### Database Constraints:

Database constraints enforce rules or restrictions on the data stored in tables:

1.  **Primary Key**:
    1.  Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
    2.  Example: `PRIMARY KEY (column_name)`
2.  **Unique Constraint**:
    1.  Ensures that each value in a column is unique.
    2.  Example: `UNIQUE (column_name)`
3.  **Not Null Constraint**:
    1.  Requires that a column cannot contain NULL values.
    2.  Example: `column_name DATATYPE NOT NULL`
4.  **Foreign Key Constraint**:
    1.  Establishes a relationship between two tables.
    2.  Example: `FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES other_table(column_name)`
5.  **Default Constraint**:
    1.  Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified during insertion.
    2.  Example: `column_name DATATYPE DEFAULT default_value`
6.  **Check Constraint**:
    1.  Validates data based on a specified condition.
    2.  *Note*: MySQL does not directly support the CHECK constraint, but you can enforce it using triggers or application-level logic.

### Aggregate Functions:

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value as the result:

1.  **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows in a result set.
2.  **SUM()**: Calculates the sum of values in a column.
3.  **AVG()**: Calculates the average of values in a column.
4.  **MIN()**: Retrieves the minimum value from a column.
5.  **MAX()**: Retrieves the maximum value from a column.

### Grouping Things Together:

Grouping operations allow you to aggregate data based on common attributes using GROUP BY and filter grouped results using the HAVING clause:

1.  **GROUP BY**:

Groups rows sharing a common value into summary rows.

```sql
-- Example 1: Count the number of employees in each department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

1.  **HAVING**:

Filters the grouped results based on specified conditions.

```sql
-- Example 2: Count the number of employees in each department with more than 5 employees
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

In these SQL queries:

-   The `SELECT` statement retrieves data from the "employees" table.
-   The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows by the "department" column.
-   The `COUNT(*)` function calculates the number of rows in each group.
-   The `HAVING` clause filters the grouped results based on the condition specified after `HAVING`.

### LIKE Operator:

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column:

**Percent Sign (%):** The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters.

**Underscore (_):** The underscore (_) represents a single character.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name LIKE 'Sm%';
```

This query retrieves all employees whose last names start with 'Sm'.

### DISTINCT Keyword:

The DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

This query retrieves unique department names from the employees table.

### Sorting (ORDER BY Clause):

The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

This query retrieves all employees sorted in descending order of their salary.

### BETWEEN...AND Operators:

The BETWEEN...AND operators are used to filter the result set within a specified range:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 50;
```

This query retrieves products with prices between 10 and 50 (inclusive).

### Comparing Nulls (IS NULL/IS NOT NULL):

The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators are used to check for NULL values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
```

This query retrieves employees who do not have a manager.

### IN/NOT IN Operators:

The IN and NOT IN operators are used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Finance');
```

This query retrieves employees from the IT, HR, and Finance departments.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department NOT IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Finance');
```

This query retrieves employees from departments other than IT, HR, and Finance.

### Relational Algebra Operations:

1.  **Selection (σ)**:
    1.  Selects tuples (rows) from a relation (table) that satisfy a specified condition.
    2.  Example: σ_department='IT'(Employees) selects employees from the IT department.
2.  **Projection (π)**:
    1.  Selects specific columns (attributes) from a relation, discarding others.
    2.  Example: π_employee_name, department(Employees) selects only the employee name and department columns.
3.  **Union (∪)**:
    1.  Combines tuples from two relations, removing duplicates.
    2.  Example: R ∪ S returns a relation containing all tuples from R and S, eliminating duplicates.
4.  **Intersection (∩)**:
    1.  Returns tuples that are common to both relations.
    2.  Example: R ∩ S returns a relation containing only the tuples present in both R and S.
5.  **Difference (−)**:
    1.  Returns tuples that are in one relation but not in the other.
    2.  Example: R - S returns a relation containing only the tuples present in R but not in S.
6.  **Cartesian Product (×)**:
    1.  Combines all tuples from two relations, resulting in a new relation with every possible combination of tuples.
    2.  Example: R × S returns a relation with tuples from R concatenated with tuples from S.

### SQL Joins:

1.  **Equi Join**:
    1.  Joins tables based on equality between values in specified columns.
    2.  Example: `SELECT * FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON Table1.column = Table2.column;`
2.  **Inner Join**:
    1.  Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
    2.  Example: `SELECT * FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON Table1.column = Table2.column;`
3.  **Outer Join (Left, Right, Full)**:
    1.  Left Outer Join: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
    2.  Right Outer Join: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
    3.  Full Outer Join: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
    4.  Example: `SELECT * FROM Table1 LEFT OUTER JOIN Table2 ON Table1.column = Table2.column;`
4.  **Natural Join**:
    1.  Joins tables based on columns with the same name.
    2.  Example: `SELECT * FROM Table1 NATURAL JOIN Table2;`
5.  **Cross Join**:
    1.  Returns the Cartesian product of two tables (all possible combinations).
    2.  Example: `SELECT * FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2;`

### SQL Standard Syntax for Joins:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM Table1
JOIN Table2 ON Table1.column = Table2.column;
```

### Copying Table Structure/Data:

1.  **Copying Table Structure**:
    1.  Use the `CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT` statement.
    2.  Example: `CREATE TABLE NewTable AS SELECT * FROM OldTable WHERE 1=0;`
2.  **Copying Table Data**:
    1.  Use the `INSERT INTO...SELECT` statement.
    2.  Example: `INSERT INTO NewTable SELECT * FROM OldTable;`

### Sequences (AUTO_INCREMENT):

In MySQL, the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute is used to automatically generate unique values for a column.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Department VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In this example, the `EmployeeID` column will automatically increment with each new record inserted into the Employees table.

Certainly! Let's delve into the SQL operations you've mentioned:

### Union/Union All:

1.  **Union**:

Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicate rows.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

1.  **Union All**:

Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements, including duplicate rows.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

### Queries on Various Types of Joins:

**Old Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders, Customers
WHERE Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

**SQL Standard Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

### Copying Table Structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE NewTable LIKE OldTable;
```

### Copying Data from One Table to Another:

```sql
INSERT INTO NewTable SELECT * FROM OldTable;
```

Let's dive into subqueries, correlated subqueries, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, transaction control commands (TCL), data control language commands (DCL), and views:

### Subquery:

-   A subquery is a query nested within another query.
-   It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.
-   Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location_id = 1700);
```

### Correlated Subquery:

-   A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query.
-   It executes once for each row processed by the outer query.
-   Example:

```sql
SELECT employee_name FROM employees e WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
```

### EXISTS/NOT EXISTS:

-   EXISTS returns TRUE if a subquery returns one or more rows.
-   NOT EXISTS returns TRUE if a subquery returns no rows.
-   Example:

```sql
SELECT employee_name FROM employees e WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.employee_id = e.employee_id);
```

### TCL Commands (Transaction Control Language):

1.  **COMMIT**:
    1.  Saves all changes made during the current transaction to the database.
    2.  Syntax: `COMMIT;`
2.  **ROLLBACK**:
    1.  Reverts all changes made during the current transaction to its initial state.
    2.  Syntax: `ROLLBACK;`
3.  **SAVEPOINT**:
    1.  Sets a named point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
    2.  Syntax: `SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;`

### DCL Commands (Data Control Language):

1.  **GRANT**:
    1.  Gives specific privileges to users or roles.
    2.  Syntax: `GRANT privileges ON object TO user;`
2.  **REVOKE**:
    1.  Removes previously granted privileges from users or roles.
    2.  Syntax: `REVOKE privileges ON object FROM user;`
3.  **GRANT OPTION**:
    1.  Allows a user to grant privileges to other users.
    2.  Syntax: `GRANT privilege ON object TO user WITH GRANT OPTION;`

### Views:

-   Views are virtual tables generated by a query.
-   They provide a way to present data in a predefined format.
-   Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_details AS SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary FROM employees;
```

### Types of Views:

1.  **Simple Views**:
    1.  Based on a single table.
    2.  Example: `CREATE VIEW employee_details AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 100;`
2.  **Complex Views**:
    1.  Based on multiple tables and may involve joins or subqueries.
    2.  Example: `CREATE VIEW employee_salary AS SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);`

### Creating Views:

Views are virtual tables generated by a query. Here's how you can create views:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

### Querying Using Views:

Once a view is created, you can query it like a regular table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_name;
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_salary_employees;
```

### Creating Indexes:

Indexes are used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables. Here's how you can create indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department_id ON employees (department_id);
```

### Creating Temporary Tables:

Temporary tables are tables that exist only for the duration of a database session. Here's how you can create temporary tables:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
```

Example:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_employee (
    employee_id INT,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);
```

Temporary tables are useful for storing intermediate results or temporary data during complex queries or data manipulation operations within a session. They are automatically dropped when the session ends.

### Indexes:

-   **Definition**: Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables by providing quick access to rows based on the values of certain columns.
-   **Benefits of Indexes**:
    -   **Faster Data Retrieval**: Indexes allow the database engine to quickly locate specific rows, reducing the time required to execute queries.
    -   **Improved Performance**: Queries involving indexed columns often execute faster, leading to improved overall database performance.
    -   **Efficient Data Access**: Indexes help in optimizing data access paths, especially for large tables.
    -   **Support for Constraints**: Indexes can enforce unique constraints and primary key constraints on tables.
-   **Types of Indexes**:
    -   **Primary Index**: Index created automatically on the primary key column(s) of a table.
    -   **Unique Index**: Ensures that the indexed columns contain unique values, except for NULLs.
    -   **Composite Index**: Index created on multiple columns.
    -   **Full-Text Index**: Supports full-text search on text columns.
    -   **Spatial Index**: Used for spatial data types to optimize spatial queries.
    -   **Covering Index**: Contains all the columns needed to satisfy a query, avoiding the need to access the actual table data.

### Temporary Tables:

-   **Definition**: Temporary tables are tables that exist temporarily and are visible only to the session that creates them. They are automatically dropped when the session ends.
-   **Usage**:
    -   Storing intermediate results during complex queries or data manipulation operations.
    -   Sharing temporary data within a session without affecting other sessions.
    -   Staging data for subsequent processing steps within a session.

### ACID Properties:

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure the reliability and integrity of database transactions:

1.  **Atomicity**: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, either all of its operations are executed, or none are.
2.  **Consistency**: Guarantees that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction, regardless of concurrent transactions.
3.  **Isolation**: Ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently does not interfere with each other, maintaining data integrity.
4.  **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive system failures, ensuring data persistence.

### Database Instance and Schema:

-   **Database Instance**: A database instance refers to the running environment of a database system, including the memory structures, background processes, and data files. It represents the state of a database system at a particular point in time.
-   **Schema**: A schema is a logical container that organizes and defines the structure of objects within a database, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. It defines the database's structure, including the tables, their columns, data types, relationships, and constraints.

### MySQL Storage Engines (InnoDB, MyISAM, and Others):

-   **InnoDB**: A transactional storage engine for MySQL that provides ACID compliance, row-level locking, and foreign key constraints. It is the default storage engine for MySQL.
-   **MyISAM**: A non-transactional storage engine for MySQL that offers high performance for read-heavy workloads but lacks support for transactions and foreign keys.
-   **Others**: MySQL supports several other storage engines, including MEMORY (HEAP), CSV, ARCHIVE, and more. Each storage engine has its own advantages and use cases, such as specialized performance characteristics or storage requirements.

### Introduction to MySQL Programming:

MySQL programming involves writing code to interact with MySQL databases using SQL statements and other programming constructs. This can include:

-   Creating, modifying, and querying database objects like tables, views, indexes, and stored procedures.
-   Inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data from database tables.
-   Implementing data manipulation logic, business rules, and data integrity constraints within the database.

### Use of MySQL Programs:

MySQL programs are command-line utilities and graphical tools provided by MySQL to interact with MySQL databases. These programs include:

1.  **Command-Line Utilities**:
    1.  MySQL Client: Allows users to interact with MySQL servers through a command-line interface.
    2.  MySQLdump: Used for backup and restore operations by exporting and importing MySQL databases.
    3.  MySQLimport: Imports data into MySQL tables from various file formats.
    4.  MySQLadmin: Performs administrative tasks such as server monitoring, user management, and database maintenance.
2.  **Graphical Tools**:
    1.  MySQL Workbench: A comprehensive graphical tool for database design, development, and administration.
    2.  phpMyAdmin: A web-based administration tool for managing MySQL databases using a web browser.
    3.  Navicat for MySQL: A commercial database administration tool with features for database design, data manipulation, and data modeling.

### Introduction to Stored Procedures:

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code stored in the database catalog. They allow you to encapsulate complex SQL logic and business rules within the database itself.

### Benefits of Stored Procedures:

1.  **Improved Performance**:
    1.  Stored procedures are precompiled and cached, reducing the overhead of query parsing and optimization.
    2.  They can reduce network traffic by executing multiple SQL statements in a single procedure call.
2.  **Enhanced Security**:
    1.  Stored procedures can restrict direct access to tables and views, allowing fine-grained control over database access.
    2.  They reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks by parameterizing inputs and preventing dynamic SQL execution.
3.  **Modularity and Reusability**:
    1.  Stored procedures promote code reuse by encapsulating common logic that can be called from multiple applications or other stored procedures.
    2.  They facilitate modular development and maintenance of database applications by separating business logic from application code.

### Procedure Parameters (IN, OUT, and INOUT):

-   **IN Parameters**: Used to pass input values to the stored procedure. They are read-only within the procedure and cannot be modified.
-   **OUT Parameters**: Used to return output values from the stored procedure. They are uninitialized when passed into the procedure and must be assigned a value within the procedure.
-   **INOUT Parameters**: Used for both input and output. They can be read from and written to within the procedure, allowing bidirectional data flow.

### Creating Procedure Without Parameters:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount()
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;
END;
```

### Creating Procedure with (IN/OUT/INOUT) Parameters:

```sql
-- Procedure with IN parameter
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByID (IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END;

-- Procedure with OUT parameter
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeNameByID (IN emp_id INT, OUT emp_name VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
    SELECT employee_name INTO emp_name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END;

-- Procedure with INOUT parameter
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeSalary (INOUT emp_id INT, IN salary DECIMAL(10,2))
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET employee_salary = salary WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END;
```

In these examples:

-   `IN` parameters are used to pass values into the procedure.
-   `OUT` parameters are used to return values from the procedure.
-   `INOUT` parameters allow bidirectional data flow, enabling both input and output functionality within the procedure.

### 

### Flow Control Statements:

1.  **LOOP Statement**:
    1.  Repeats a block of statements indefinitely until a specific condition is met.
    2.  Example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE LoopExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 0;
    my_loop: LOOP
        SET counter = counter + 1;
        IF counter = 5 THEN
            LEAVE my_loop;
        END IF;
        SELECT counter;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

1.  **WHILE Statement**:
    1.  Executes a block of statements repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
    2.  Example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE WhileExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1;
    WHILE counter <= 5 DO
        SELECT counter;
        SET counter = counter + 1;
    END WHILE;
END;
```

1.  **REPEAT Statement**:
    1.  Executes a block of statements repeatedly until a specified condition is true.
    2.  Example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE RepeatExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1;
    REPEAT
        SELECT counter;
        SET counter = counter + 1;
    UNTIL counter > 5 END REPEAT;
END;
```

### Using Flow Control Statements in Stored Procedures/Functions:

You can use flow control statements within stored procedures/functions to implement complex logic and control the execution flow based on specific conditions or iterations.

### Conditional Statements:

1.  **IF Statement**:

Executes a block of statements if a specified condition is true.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE IfExample(IN value INT)
BEGIN
    IF value > 0 THEN
        SELECT 'Positive';
    END IF;
END;
```

1.  **IF-ELSE-THEN Statement**:

Executes one block of statements if a specified condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE IfElseExample(IN value INT)
BEGIN
    IF value > 0 THEN
        SELECT 'Positive';
    ELSE
        SELECT 'Non-Positive';
    END IF;
END;
```

1.  **CASE Statement**:

Evaluates a series of conditions and executes the corresponding block of statements for the first condition that evaluates to true.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE CaseExample(IN value INT)
BEGIN
    CASE
        WHEN value > 0 THEN SELECT 'Positive';
        WHEN value < 0 THEN SELECT 'Negative';
        ELSE SELECT 'Zero';
    END CASE;
END;
```

### Loop Constructs (ITERATE, LEAVE):

MySQL provides loop constructs within stored procedures to perform iterative operations. Two key constructs are:

1.  **ITERATE**:

Used to iterate to the next iteration within a loop.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE IterateExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 0;
    my_loop: LOOP
        SET counter = counter + 1;
        IF counter = 5 THEN
            LEAVE my_loop; -- Exit the loop when counter reaches 5
        END IF;
        ITERATE my_loop; -- Move to the next iteration
        SELECT counter;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

1.  **LEAVE**:

Used to exit a loop prematurely.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE LeaveExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 0;
    my_loop: LOOP
        SET counter = counter + 1;
        IF counter = 5 THEN
           LEAVE my_loop; -- Exit the loop when counter reaches 5
        END IF;
        SELECT counter;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

### Functions with and Without Parameters:

MySQL allows the creation of user-defined functions (UDFs) with and without parameters:

1.  **Function Without Parameters**:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION HelloWorld() RETURNS VARCHAR(50)
BEGIN
    RETURN 'Hello, World!';
END;
```

1.  **Function with Parameters**:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION AddNumbers(x INT, y INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE result INT;
    SET result = x + y;
    RETURN result;
END;
```

### MySQL Built-in Functions:

MySQL provides a wide range of built-in functions for various purposes, including string manipulation, numeric operations, date and time functions, and more. Here are some examples:

-   **String Functions**:
    -   `CONCAT(str1, str2)`: Concatenates two or more strings.
    -   `SUBSTRING(str, start, length)`: Returns a substring from a string.
    -   `UPPER(str)`: Converts a string to uppercase.
-   **Numeric Functions**:
    -   `ABS(x)`: Returns the absolute value of a number.
    -   `ROUND(x, d)`: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
    -   `CEIL(x)`: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.
-   **Date and Time Functions**:
    -   `NOW()`: Returns the current date and time.
    -   `DATE_FORMAT(date, format)`: Formats a date as specified by the format string.
    -   `DATEDIFF(date1, date2)`: Returns the number of days between two dates.

These are just a few examples of MySQL built-in functions. MySQL provides a rich set of functions to handle various data manipulation and calculation tasks within SQL queries and stored procedures.

### Cursors in MySQL:

Cursors in MySQL are database objects used to traverse the records in a result set returned by a SELECT query. Cursors can be sensitive or insensitive, read-only or updatable, and scrollable or non-scrollable. Here's a breakdown of each type:

1.  **Asensitive**:
    1.  An asensitive cursor does not detect changes made to the underlying data by other transactions while the cursor is open.
2.  **Insensitive**:
    1.  An insensitive cursor creates a snapshot of the result set and does not reflect changes made to the underlying data by other transactions while the cursor is open.
3.  **Read-only**:
    1.  A read-only cursor does not allow updates to the underlying data through the cursor.
4.  **Nonscrollable**:
    1.  A nonscrollable cursor can only move forward through the result set and cannot move backward or randomly access rows.

Here's an example of how to declare and use a cursor in MySQL:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessEmployees()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE emp_id INT;
    DECLARE emp_name VARCHAR(100);
    
    -- Declare the cursor
    DECLARE employee_cursor CURSOR FOR
        SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees;
    
    -- Declare handler for when no more rows are found
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;
    
    -- Open the cursor
    OPEN employee_cursor;
    
    -- Loop through the result set
    employee_loop: LOOP
        -- Fetch the next row
        FETCH employee_cursor INTO emp_id, emp_name;
        
        -- Check if no more rows
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE employee_loop;
        END IF;
        
        -- Process the current row (example: print employee name)
        SELECT CONCAT('Employee Name: ', emp_name);
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Close the cursor
    CLOSE employee_cursor;
END;
```

Real-time use cases for cursors include:

-   Data processing tasks requiring row-by-row traversal of result sets.
-   Complex data transformations or calculations involving multiple rows.
-   Cursor-based navigation in graphical user interfaces (e.g., web applications displaying paginated data).
-   ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for data migration or data warehousing.

## Triggers in MySQL:

Triggers in MySQL are database objects that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. There are two main types of triggers: BEFORE triggers and AFTER triggers.

### BEFORE Triggers:

BEFORE triggers execute before the triggering event (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) takes place on the table. They can be used to modify the values being inserted, updated, or deleted.

### AFTER Triggers:

AFTER triggers execute after the triggering event has completed. They can be used to perform actions based on the changes made by the triggering event.

### New and Old Trigger Variables:

-   **NEW**: Contains the new values of the row being affected by an INSERT or UPDATE operation.
-   **OLD**: Contains the old values of the row being affected by an UPDATE or DELETE operation.

### Trigger Examples and Real-Time Use:

Let's consider a scenario where we have a table called `employees` and we want to maintain a log of changes made to it.

#### Example of a BEFORE Trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.salary < OLD.salary THEN
        INSERT INTO salary_change_log (employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date)
        VALUES (NEW.employee_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, NOW());
    END IF;
END;
```

#### Example of an AFTER Trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_delete
AFTER DELETE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_delete_log (employee_id, deleted_at)
    VALUES (OLD.employee_id, NOW());
END;
```

### Real-Time Use of Triggers:

1.  **Auditing Changes**: Triggers can be used to maintain audit logs of changes made to critical data.
2.  **Enforcing Business Rules**: Triggers can enforce complex business rules or data integrity constraints.
3.  **Synchronization**: Triggers can be used to synchronize data between different tables or systems.
4.  **Denormalization**: Triggers can automatically update denormalized data in response to changes in normalized tables.

In a real-world scenario, triggers are commonly used for auditing purposes, enforcing business rules, and maintaining data integrity. For instance, a trigger can log every change made to a customer's order, ensuring transparency and accountability in the system.

### Error Handling and Exceptions:

MySQL provides the following types of handler actions for error handling:

1.  **CONTINUE**: Proceed with the execution of subsequent statements after handling the error.
2.  **EXIT**: Terminate the current block (e.g., stored procedure, function) and return control to the caller.
3.  **UNDO**: Roll back the changes made within the current block.

### Writing a Handler:

Handlers are defined within the scope of a BEGIN...END block in stored procedures or functions. The syntax for writing a handler is as follows:

```sql
DECLARE handler_action HANDLER FOR condition_value
    statement;
```

-   `handler_action`: Specifies the action to be taken when the specified condition occurs.
-   `condition_value`: Specifies the condition for which the handler should be activated.
-   `statement`: Specifies the SQL statement or block of statements to be executed when the condition occurs.

### Defining and Handling Exceptions in Stored Procedures and Functions:

Here's an example of how to define and handle exceptions within a stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ExampleProcedure()
BEGIN
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        -- Handle SQL exceptions (errors)
        ROLLBACK; -- Rollback changes made within the procedure
        SELECT 'An error occurred: ', SQLSTATE, SQLERRM;
    END;

    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND
    BEGIN
        -- Handle NOT FOUND condition (no rows found)
        SELECT 'No rows found.';
    END;

    -- Your SQL statements here
END;
```

In this example:

-   We define handlers for both SQLEXCEPTION (any SQL error) and NOT FOUND (no rows found) conditions.
-   When an exception occurs, the corresponding handler is activated, and the specified actions are executed.
-   We use handlers to roll back changes in case of an error and provide feedback or handle the NOT FOUND condition appropriately.

By using handlers effectively, you can enhance the robustness of your stored procedures and functions, ensuring proper error management and exception handling.

# NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases, often referred to as "Not Only SQL," provide a flexible alternative to traditional relational databases for handling large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. Here's an introduction to NoSQL databases and their features, along with a comparison of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data:

### Introduction to NoSQL Database:

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed to handle various types of data that do not fit well into the tabular structure of traditional relational databases. They are widely used for web applications, big data, real-time analytics, and other scenarios where scalability, flexibility, and performance are paramount.

### Features of NoSQL Database:

1.  **Schemaless Design**: NoSQL databases typically do not enforce a rigid schema, allowing for dynamic and flexible data modeling.
2.  **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can easily distribute data across multiple servers to handle increasing loads.
3.  **High Performance**: NoSQL databases are optimized for specific use cases, offering high throughput and low latency for read and write operations.
4.  **Flexibility**: NoSQL databases support various data models, including key-value stores, document stores, column-family stores, and graph databases, catering to diverse application requirements.
5.  **Support for Big Data**: NoSQL databases excel at handling large volumes of data, making them suitable for big data analytics and real-time processing.
6.  **Fault Tolerance**: Many NoSQL databases provide built-in fault tolerance and replication mechanisms to ensure data durability and availability.
7.  **ACID Properties**: While some NoSQL databases sacrifice strict ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for scalability and performance, others offer configurable consistency levels to meet application needs.

### Structured vs. Semi-Structured and Unstructured Data:

1.  **Structured Data**:
    1.  Structured data follows a fixed schema and is organized into tables with rows and columns.
    2.  Examples include data stored in relational databases, such as customer information, transaction records, and inventory data.
2.  **Semi-Structured Data**:
    1.  Semi-structured data does not adhere to a rigid schema but has some organizational structure.
    2.  It may be represented in formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), or key-value pairs.
    3.  Examples include JSON documents representing user profiles, XML documents representing configuration files, or key-value pairs in log files.
3.  **Unstructured Data**:
    1.  Unstructured data lacks a predefined schema and does not fit neatly into rows and columns.
    2.  It includes text, images, videos, audio files, social media posts, and sensor data.
    3.  Analyzing unstructured data often requires natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, or other advanced techniques to extract meaningful insights.

NoSQL databases are particularly well-suited for managing semi-structured and unstructured data due to their flexible data models and horizontal scalability, making them a popular choice for modern data-intensive applications.

### Difference between RDBMS and NoSQL Databases:

| Aspect         | RDBMS                                                                                                              | NoSQL                                                                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Model     | Relational databases use a tabular schema with predefined relationships between tables.                            | NoSQL databases offer various data models, including key-value pairs, documents, columns, and graphs.              |
| Schema         | Relational databases enforce a strict schema where the structure of data must be defined upfront.                  | NoSQL databases typically have a flexible or schema-less design, allowing for dynamic schema changes.              |
| Scaling        | Relational databases are vertically scalable, meaning they scale by increasing the power of individual servers.    | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, allowing data to be distributed across multiple servers.                |
| Transactions   | Relational databases support ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for data integrity. | NoSQL databases may sacrifice some ACID properties for scalability and performance, offering eventual consistency. |
| Query Language | Relational databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.                       | NoSQL databases may support SQL-like query languages or proprietary APIs tailored to their specific data models.   |

### 

### CAP Theorem:

The CAP theorem states that it's impossible for a distributed data system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

1.  **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
2.  **Availability**: Every request receives a response, without guaranteeing that it contains the most recent write.
3.  **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication failures) between nodes.

According to the CAP theorem, a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three properties at any given time. NoSQL databases often prioritize partition tolerance and availability over strict consistency, allowing them to remain operational under network failures.

### BASE Model:

The BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) is an alternative approach to distributed systems design, contrasting with the ACID properties of traditional RDBMS:

1.  **Basically Available**: The system remains operational and responsive even under failures or network partitions.
2.  **Soft state**: The system may exhibit temporary inconsistency due to concurrent updates or delayed propagation of changes.
3.  **Eventually Consistent**: Over time, all replicas of data will converge to a consistent state, but there may be a temporary period of inconsistency.

### Categories of NoSQL Databases:

1.  **Key-Value Stores**: Store data as a collection of key-value pairs, offering high performance and scalability. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.
2.  **Document Stores**: Store data in flexible JSON-like documents, allowing nested structures and dynamic schemas. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.
3.  **Column-Oriented Stores**: Store data in columns rather than rows, optimizing for analytical queries and data compression. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.
4.  **Graph Databases**: Store data as nodes, edges, and properties, enabling efficient traversal of complex relationships. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.

Each category of NoSQL database is optimized for different use cases and data access patterns, providing developers with a wide range of options for building scalable and flexible data systems.

### Introduction to MongoDB:

MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility for managing semi-structured and unstructured data. Here's an introduction to MongoDB and its features:

### Features of MongoDB:

1.  **Document-Oriented**: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for nested structures and dynamic schemas.
2.  **Schemaless Design**: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for easy and dynamic schema changes, accommodating evolving data requirements without requiring downtime.
3.  **High Performance**: MongoDB offers high-performance read and write operations, with support for indexes, sharding, and in-memory caching for efficient data access.
4.  **Horizontal Scalability**: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing for seamless distribution of data and workload.
5.  **Rich Query Language**: MongoDB provides a powerful query language with support for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), aggregation pipelines, and geospatial queries.
6.  **Replication and Fault Tolerance**: MongoDB supports replica sets for data redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring data durability and high availability.
7.  **Auto-Sharding**: MongoDB's built-in sharding capabilities enable automatic distribution of data across multiple shards, providing linear scalability for large datasets.
8.  **Flexible Data Model**: MongoDB's flexible data model allows for easy storage of diverse data types, including documents, arrays, and embedded documents, facilitating complex data structures.

### MongoDB Command Interface:

MongoDB provides a command-line interface (CLI) called `mongo` or `mongosh` for interacting with MongoDB servers. Users can use the CLI to perform various operations, including connecting to databases, executing queries, managing collections, and configuring servers.

### MongoDB Compass:

MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool provided by MongoDB for interacting with MongoDB databases. It offers a user-friendly interface for visually exploring and manipulating data, designing schemas, executing queries, and monitoring database performance.

MongoDB Compass features include:

MongoDB Compass enhances the MongoDB user experience by providing a powerful and intuitive interface for database management and development tasks, suitable for both beginners and experienced MongoDB users.

### MongoDB Documents & Collections:

-   **Documents**: In MongoDB, a document is a set of key-value pairs (like JSON objects) stored in a BSON format. It is the basic unit of data in MongoDB and corresponds to a row or record in relational databases.
-   **Collections**: Collections in MongoDB are analogous to tables in RDBMS. A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents, similar to how tables in RDBMS contain rows of related data.

### RDBMS & MongoDB Analogies:

-   **Relations/Tables =\> Collections**: Both represent a grouping of related data. In RDBMS, data is organized in tables, while in MongoDB, it's organized in collections.
-   **Tuples/Records =\> Documents**: Each row in an RDBMS table (tuple/record) corresponds to a MongoDB document. Documents store data as field-value pairs, similar to rows in RDBMS.

### JSON and BSON Documents:

-   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A human-readable format for representing data as key-value pairs. MongoDB uses a JSON-like syntax for querying and manipulating documents.
-   **BSON (Binary JSON)**: MongoDB stores data in BSON format, which is a binary representation of JSON documents. BSON supports additional data types and is more efficient for storage and transmission.

### CRUD Operations in MongoDB:

1.  **CREATE**: Insert documents into a collection using the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods.
2.  **READ**: Retrieve documents from a collection using the `find()` method with optional query criteria.
3.  **UPDATE**: Update documents in a collection using the `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` methods.
4.  **DELETE**: Remove documents from a collection using the `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods.
5.  **UPSERT**: Perform an "upsert" operation to insert a document if it does not exist or update it if it does, using the `updateOne()` method with the `upsert: true` option.

### MongoDB Operators, Sorting, Indexing:

-   **Operators**: MongoDB provides various query and update operators to perform specific operations on documents, such as comparison, logical, array, and text search operators.
-   **Sorting**: The `sort()` method in MongoDB allows sorting query results based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order.
-   **Indexing**: MongoDB supports the creation of indexes on fields in collections to improve query performance. Indexes can be created using the `createIndex()` method and can be customized for different use cases.

### 

### Creating a Database, Connecting to a Database, Creating Collections:

1.  **Creating a Database**: In MongoDB, databases are created implicitly when collections are first created within them. To switch to a specific database or create a new one, you can use the `use` command:

```mongodb
use my_database
```

1.  **Connecting to a Database**: To connect to a MongoDB database using the MongoDB shell, you can use the `mongo` command followed by the connection string:

```bash
mongo mongodb://localhost:27017/my_database
```

1.  **Creating Collections**: Collections are created automatically when you insert documents into them. You can also explicitly create collections using the `createCollection()` method:

```mongodb
db.createCollection("my_collection")
```

### Performing CRUD Operations:

1.  **CREATE**: Insert documents into a collection using the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods:

```mongodb
db.my_collection.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 30 })
```

1.  **READ**: Retrieve documents from a collection using the `find()` method:

```mongodb
db.my_collection.find()
```

1.  **UPDATE**: Update documents in a collection using the `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` methods:

```mongodb
db.my_collection.updateOne({ name: "John" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })
```

1.  **DELETE**: Remove documents from a collection using the `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods:

```mongodb
db.my_collection.deleteOne({ name: "John" })
```

### Complex Read Using Operators, Sorting Operations, Creating Indexes:

1.  **Using Operators**: MongoDB provides various operators for complex querying. For example, to find documents where the age is greater than 25:

```mongodb
db.my_collection.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } })
```

1.  **Sorting Operations**: To sort query results, use the `sort()` method:

```mongodb
db.my_collection.find().sort({ age: 1 }) // Sort by age in ascending order
```

1.  **Creating Indexes**: Indexes can improve query performance. To create an index on the `age` field:

```mongodb
db.my_collection.createIndex({ age: 1 })
```

These commands demonstrate basic database operations in MongoDB, including database and collection creation, CRUD operations, complex querying using operators, sorting, and indexing. Understanding these operations is essential for building and managing MongoDB databases effectively.
