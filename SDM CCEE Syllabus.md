    7.  Addressing these challenges requires fostering a collaborative culture, providing mentorship opportunities, conducting regular communication, and resolving conflicts constructively.
3.  **Introduction to Code Versioning System**:
    1.  A code versioning system (or version control system) tracks changes to files and directories over time.
    2.  It enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently.
    3.  Key features include recording changes made to files, facilitating concurrent work on the same codebase, branching and merging, and providing a history of changes for accountability and troubleshooting.
4.  **History of Code Versioning System**:
    1.  Evolution from early systems like RCS and CVS to modern distributed version control systems (DVCS) like Git and Mercurial.
    2.  Advancements in technology and changes in development practices have shaped the evolution of versioning systems.
    3.  Features such as branching, merging, tagging, and distributed workflows have become standard in modern version control tools.
5.  **Different Tools Available for Versioning**:
    1.  Popular version control tools include Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, Perforce, and Microsoft Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).
    2.  Teams should evaluate their requirements, such as scalability, branching model support, integration with other tools, and ease of use, to choose the most suitable versioning tool for their project.
6.  **Software Development Workflow**:
    1.  Various software development workflows exist, including Waterfall, Agile (Scrum, Kanban), and hybrid approaches.
    2.  Stages typically include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

**Git**:

1.  **Introduction to Git**:
    -   Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development.
    -   It tracks changes to files, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on projects.
    -   Git facilitates version control by recording snapshots of the project's files at different points in time.
    -   It offers features like branching, merging, and tagging, allowing for flexible and efficient development workflows.
2.  **Introduction to Git Repository and Git Structure**:
    -   A Git repository is a collection of files and folders managed by Git.
    -   It contains the project's entire history, including all changes made to the files over time.
    -   Git repositories can be local (on your computer) or remote (hosted on a server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
    -   The basic Git structure includes the working directory, staging area (index), and repository (local or remote).
3.  **Adding Code to Git**:
    -   To add code to Git, first initialize a Git repository in your project directory using the `git init` command.
    -   Add files to the staging area using `git add <file>` or `git add .` to add all files.
    -   Commit changes to the repository using `git commit -m "Commit message"` to save the staged changes.
    -   Use `git status` to check the status of files in the working directory and staging area.
4.  **Creating and Merging Different Git Branches**:
    -   Branching in Git allows for parallel development and isolation of features or fixes.
    -   Create a new branch using `git branch <branch_name>` and switch to it with `git checkout <branch_name>` or `git switch <branch_name>`.
    -   Make changes on the new branch and commit them.
    -   Merge branches together using `git merge <branch_name>` to integrate changes from one branch into another.
    -   Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise during the merge process.
    -   Delete branches after they are no longer needed using `git branch -d <branch_name>`.
5.  **Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository**:
    -   After committing changes to your local repository, you can push them to a remote repository to share them with others.
    -   Add a remote repository using `git remote add <name> <url>` to specify the URL of the remote repository.
    -   Push changes to the remote repository using `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>` to upload commits from your local branch to the remote branch.
    -   Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local branch.
6.  **Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository**:
    -   To retrieve changes from a remote repository, use `git fetch <remote_name>` to download changes without merging them.
    -   Merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch using `git merge <remote_name>/<branch_name>` or `git pull` to fetch and merge changes in one step.
7.  **Handling Merge Conflicts**:
    -   Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches.
    -   To resolve merge conflicts, manually edit the conflicting files to reconcile the differences.
    -   After resolving conflicts, add the modified files to the staging area using `git add <file>` and commit the changes to complete the merge process.
8.  **Branch Management and Best Practices**:
    -   Delete merged branches using `git branch -d <branch_name>` to keep the repository clean.
    -   Use descriptive branch names to indicate the purpose of each branch.
    -   Regularly merge changes from the main branch (e.g., `master` or `main`) into feature branches to keep them up-to-date.
    -   Avoid long-lived branches to minimize the risk of merge conflicts and divergent codebases.

**Tools Used for Automation Testing**:

-   Automation testing tools automate the execution of test cases and facilitate test management and reporting. Examples include Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, and Robot Framework.

**Introduction to Testing Methods: White-box, Black-box, and Grey-box**:

-   **White-box Testing** involves testing internal structures or workings of a software application. Testers have access to the source code and design details.
-   **Black-box Testing** focuses on testing the functionality of the software without knowledge of its internal implementation. Testers interact with the software interface to validate inputs and outputs.
-   **Grey-box Testing** combines elements of both white-box and black-box testing. Testers have limited knowledge of the internal workings but enough to design effective test cases.

**Introduction to Functional Testing**:

-   **Functional Testing** evaluates the functionality of a software application by testing its features and capabilities. It ensures that the software behaves as expected and meets user requirements. Examples include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

**Introduction to Non-functional Testing**:

-   **Non-functional Testing** assesses aspects of a software application other than its functionality, such as performance, reliability, usability, security, and scalability. It ensures that the software meets quality attributes and performance requirements. Examples include performance testing, security testing, usability testing, and reliability testing.

## Selenium

**Introduction to Selenium (use Eclipse IDE)**: Selenium is a popular automation testing tool used for web application testing. It supports multiple programming languages, including Java, and can automate interactions with web browsers.

**Load WebDriver**: To load WebDriver in Eclipse, you need to include the Selenium WebDriver dependency in your project's build path. You can use Maven or download the WebDriver jar files directly.

**Create Selenium Commands**: Here are examples of Selenium commands using different locators:

1.  **By ID**:

```java
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("elementId"));
```

1.  **By Name**:

```java
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.name("elementName"));
```

1.  **By Class Name**:

```java
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.className("className"));
```

1.  **By Tag Name**:

```java
List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements(By.tagName("tagName"));
```

1.  **By XPath**:

```java
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//tag[@attribute='value']"));
```

**Add Interactions**: Here are examples of adding interactions with different elements:

1.  **Text Box**:

```java
WebElement textBox = driver.findElement(By.id("textBoxId"));
textBox.sendKeys("Text to be entered");
```

1.  **Radio Button Selection**:

```java
WebElement radioButton = driver.findElement(By.id("radioButtonId"));
radioButton.click();
```

1.  **Check Box Selection**:

```java
WebElement checkBox = driver.findElement(By.id("checkBoxId"));
checkBox.click();
```

1.  **Drop Down Item Selection**:

```java
WebElement dropdown = driver.findElement(By.id("dropdownId"));
Select select = new Select(dropdown);
select.selectByVisibleText("Option");
```

1.  **Keyboard Actions**:

```java
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
actions.sendKeys(Keys.ENTER).perform();
```

1.  **Mouse Actions**:

```java
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("elementId"));
actions.moveToElement(element).perform();
```

1.  **Multi-Select**:

```java
WebElement multiSelect = driver.findElement(By.id("multiSelectId"));
Select select = new Select(multiSelect);
select.selectByVisibleText("Option1");
select.selectByVisibleText("Option2");
```

These examples demonstrate how to interact with different elements on a web page using Selenium WebDriver in Eclipse IDE.

## Jenkins

**Introduction to Delivery Pipeline**: A delivery pipeline is like a conveyor belt, automating the steps from development to deployment, ensuring software moves through building, testing, and deploying stages systematically.

**Introduction to Jenkins**: Jenkins is an automation server that streamlines software development processes by automating tasks like compiling code, running tests, and deploying applications. It's a cornerstone of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices.

**Jenkins Management**: Jenkins is managed through its user-friendly web interface. Admins can configure settings, manage users, install plugins, and monitor job executions and server health effortlessly.

**Adding Slave Node to Jenkins**: By adding a slave node to Jenkins, you distribute workload across multiple machines, enhancing performance and scalability. Just navigate to "Manage Jenkins" \> "Manage Nodes," and click "New Node" to add a slave.

**Building a Delivery Pipeline**: In Jenkins, building a delivery pipeline involves defining a series of stages or jobs representing different steps in the software delivery process. Using Jenkins Pipeline, you can define pipelines as code for versioning, reuse, and automation.

**Selenium Integration with Jenkins**: Integrating Selenium with Jenkins entails creating jobs that execute Selenium tests as part of the delivery pipeline. Utilize plugins like Selenium WebDriver or Selenium Grid. Configure Jenkins to trigger Selenium tests automatically on code commits or scheduled intervals. Ensure proper environment setup and dependencies for running Selenium tests in Jenkins.
